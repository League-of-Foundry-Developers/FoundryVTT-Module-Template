# How to use this Template to create a versioned Release

1. Open your repository's releases page.

3. Fill out the release version as the tag name.

## <span color="red">Do not prefix your tag name with a `v`.</span>

If you want to add details at this stage you can, or you can always come back later and edit them.

4. Hit submit.

5. Wait a few minutes.

A Github Action will run to populate the `module.json` and `module.zip` with the correct urls that you can then use to distrubute this release. You can check on its status in the "Actions" tab.

6. Grab the module.json url from the release's details page.

This `module.json` will only ever point at this release's `module.zip`, making it useful for sharing a specific version for compatibility purposes.
